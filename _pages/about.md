Welcome! I’m Linh Do, a PhD in Mathematics graduated from the Department of Mathematics at Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana. I am advised by Professor [Scott A. McKinley](https://www.stochastics-lab.net/). My research focuses on particle tracking, changepoint detection algorithms, Bayesian statistics, model selection, and mixtures of models, with the goal of advancing innovative methods in applied mathematics and statistics.

Feel free to explore my work or reach out—I’d love to connect!
